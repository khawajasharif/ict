The Kindle Fire and Nook Reader do much of the same things. They can be used for browsing the Internet, watching movies and other types of videos, and of course, reading books. However, there are quite a few differences between these two products as well. The Nook Reader has been out longer but most people believe that the Kindle Fire is taking the lead as the better product out of the two because of its amazing features. You can review the information to gather an opinion on which of these products you think will be better than the other.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Kindle Fire</strong><br />
<br />
The Kindle Fire is a tablet version of the traditional kindle. It was recently released towards the end of September in 2011. Not only is it the perfect product for reading all types of books, you can also watch streaming videos and television shows. You can choose between millions of different shows and movies that are compatible with the Kindle Fire. In reality, this product is great for just about anything. You can do much of what you would do on an average day all within one product which is what consumers really like. Below is a list of just some of the many features of this product.<br />
<br />
<strong>Kindle Fire Features</strong><br />
<br />
&ndash; Movies, Shows, Books, and Magazines are all available<br />
<br />
&ndash; Apps and Games are also available<br />
<br />
&ndash; Fast Speed Web for Browsing The Net<br />
<br />
&ndash; Easy To Use Touchscreen<br />
<br />
&ndash; Amazing Color Brings Picture To Life<br />
<br />
&ndash; 8 GB Internal Memory<br />
<br />
Aside from these features, there are plenty others that the consumers seem to be raving over. The price for the Kindle Fire is $199.99 which is considerably cheaper than most of its competitors. With the Kindle Fire, you will have access to millions of books. These books will vary in genre and will be for children, teens, and adults. You get to choose what you want to read on your Kindle Fire.<br />
<br />
You can also have your pick from tons of different games and shows. Some games and shows are specifically designed for adults while others are for children. If you have children who will also be using your Kindle Fire here and there, this will be perfect for you. Popular games include Angry Birds and Words With Friends while popular music videos and songs include music from the talented Lady Gaga and Adele. You will be able to find everything you need with the Kindle Fire.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Nook Color</strong><br />
<br />
The Nook Color was created before the Kindle Fire but some changes will need to be made if Barnes and Noble wants to beat out Amazon for the top selling e-reader. When the Nook Color was first released, the price for the product was $200+. Because the Kindle Fire came out and costs approximately $199.99, Barnes and Noble was forced to lower the price of the Nook Color to $199.99 as well. This is good for you, the consumer, because now you have your choice of both great products at the same price. The company, however, may not be so happy at having to lower the price of their product. The Nook Color offers more than two million different kinds of books. Books vary in genre and adult and kids books are both available for purchase. Apps, games, and music are all available on the Nook Color too. Like the Kindle Fire, Nook Color comes equipped with many cool features that consumers love and rave over.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nook Color Features</strong><br />
<br />
&ndash; 2 million+ books<br />
<br />
&ndash; Kids books are interactive and animated<br />
<br />
&ndash; Access to some of the most popular games<br />
<br />
&ndash; E-mail and Web Browsing available<br />
<br />
&ndash; Free Support<br />
<br />
These are just a few of the different features that come along with the Nook Color. And while there are already many different features, there are plans to add some new and exciting features as the creators continue to ensure that their product is satisfying for the customers. What types of features will be added? Well, NOOK comics will soon be available which will feature tons of different Marvel comics which is perfect for comic book lovers. Another new feature expected to be added soon is available television shows and movies from NetFlix and Hulu. These are two websites that offer videos to some of the best television shows that are or were on television at some point in time. If you enjoy reading books, browsing the web, and playing some games, this may be the type of product you are looking for.<br />
<br />
When it comes to these two products, it is somewhat difficult to decide which one is the better one. Both of these products have so much to offer the consumers. In a world of technology, where people want to be able to go on the Internet, listen to music, and read books, these products are definitely continuing to advance along with the consumers.<br />
<br />
As of right now, it seems as though the Kindle Fire has a bit more to offer the consumer because they have way more than two million books, movies, and videos available along with quite a few extra features. The Kindle Fire also comes equipped with much more memory than the Nook Color which is important for people who use up a lot of memory with their videos, games, books, and music. However, it is obvious that Nook Color is making changes and adding new features so that it can keep up with and possibly surpass the Kindle Fire in the future. If you were to buy either of these products today, your best bet would be to go with the Kindle Fire.<br />
<br />
Both of these products cost about the same amount, so you will be spending the same amount of money for either one. If you prefer something that is simpler with less features, the Nook Color may be your best choice. But, if you love watching streaming videos, listening to tons of music, and playing some of the funniest games around, you would greatly benefit from buying the Kindle Fire.
