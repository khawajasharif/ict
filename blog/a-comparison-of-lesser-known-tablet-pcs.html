                            The tablet PC is where it&rsquo;s at, and the computing world is reacting accordingly.&nbsp; This means that in addition to the biggest names like the iPad and Kindle variants, a number of also-rans are jumping into the fray. Our review explores some of the tablet alternatives that have received the most positive attention.<br />
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1<br />
<br />
The first version of the Galaxy Tab was one of the opening salvos in the tablet wars.&nbsp; It was decently received, though it had a number of significant problems, most notably in its performance.&nbsp; The 10.1 model was released in the summer of 2011, and while reviews of it still noted some problems, overall scores were far higher.&nbsp; One review called it &ldquo;the best Honeycomb [Android] tablet to date&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
When the Galaxy Tab was first released it was criticized, famously by Steve Jobs, for its small size.&nbsp; While most reviewers mentioned this first thing, not all of them said it was really a negative.&nbsp; Besides its greater portability, the Galaxy Tab still manages to squeeze onto it a 1024&times;768 resolution.&nbsp; Smaller-sized tablets have since taken off as a major sub-market; sorry, Steve.<br />
<br />
Its harlequin black-on-front-white-on-back design has been called a thing of beauty.&nbsp; Of course you&rsquo;re buying a computer, not a painting.&nbsp; To that end, the reviews of its under-the-hood performance have been markedly better than that of its initial release.&nbsp; It seems to have been given a little bit of improvement in just about all areas as opposed to a great leap forward in any one or two, but in this case that&rsquo;s a good thing.&nbsp; Overall reviews of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 found a solid piece of equipment all around with little in the way of major sticking points.<br />

RIM BlackBerry PlayBook</strong><br />
<br />
We feel it appropriate to close our reviews with a BlackBerry model, as the BlackBerry was one of the main combatants in the smart phone wars from a thousand years ago.&nbsp; The BlackBerry Playbook is another smaller model, with comically miniscule buttons: the power button is all of a few millimeters in diameter.&nbsp; Like other smaller models, though, it sports an impressive resolution.&nbsp; Its screen is also 1024&times;768, and its 5 megapixel backside camera can notably take video at 1080p.<br />
<br />
Adobe Flash is fully supported out of the box, something which has become a major differentiating point among tablets.&nbsp; This is largely due to the fact that the tablet runs its own in-house operating system designed to work well with Adobe, the creatively-named BlackBerry Tablet OS.&nbsp; The downside of this operating system is that application support is not high.&nbsp; The PlayBook includes no native email or calendar applications, and its online app library isn&rsquo;t big.&nbsp; It also has no support for Android applications, though developer company Research In Motion states that this is on its way.<br />
<br />
In the end reviews were strongly mixed, with the BlackBerry Playbook getting both strongly negative and strongly positive scores.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard from looking at the evidence for us to make a clear case for either, but it does seem to be a good bet that this tablet will be around for a while.<br />

Motorola Xoom</strong><br />
<br />
The Motorola Xoom came out in February of 2001 and was considered one of the first major competitors to the iPad.&nbsp; A primary reason for this was the introduction of Android 3.0, the Google-based operating system developed specifically for mobile and tablet devices.&nbsp; Indeed, most of the early reviews of it highlighted the system&rsquo;s efficient processing and ease of use.&nbsp; Though benchmarking Androids suffers from inherent measurement problems, the Xoom typically scored high.<br />
<br />
What a difference a year makes, though.&nbsp; The Android has become the new hot OS, available in more than three dozen different tablets.&nbsp; This has caused the Xoom&rsquo;s shine to wear off a bit.&nbsp; Recent reviews of it aren&rsquo;t nearly as glowing as ones from earlier in the year.&nbsp; Given that the price hasn&rsquo;t really come down and is still hovering at around $600 with a 2-year contract, it may have lost whatever edge it might have had.<br />
<br />
Looked at in a vacuum, though, it still seems a good piece of technology.&nbsp; It has some odd design points, such as speakers and a power button in the back, and a docking station for video output.&nbsp; It also includes an inclinometer, accelerometer, magnetometer and barometer!&nbsp; In terms of computing power and usability, it still seems like a solid selection, and one that the market continues to embrace.<br />
<br />

T-Mobile G-Slate</strong><br />
<br />
The G-Slate was next on the Android parade.&nbsp; That seems to have opened up the floodgates, as a slew of other tables subsequently jumped on this new OS.&nbsp; This was good for the G-Slate, since at the time the lack of a large application library was one of its down sides.&nbsp; The price of $530 with a 2-year contract didn&rsquo;t help matters, though T-Mobile apparently took this criticism to heart, as it&rsquo;s now available for $299 with the same deal.<br />
<br />
As for the tablet&rsquo;s specifications, the new feature used to attempt differentiation from other tablets is a pair of 3D cameras on the tablet&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; This produces an old-style dual-color image, and purchase of the tablet comes with a pair of red/cyan glasses.&nbsp; Reviews of this feature were lukewarm.<br />
<br />
Overall, counting in physical and technical aspects, the G-Slate was at the time considered a major contender, with reasonably fast surfing, few bugs and comfortable handling.&nbsp; User reviews on the whole since its release have been moderately positive, and support for it appears to still be going strong.<br />
<br />

ExoPC</strong><br />
<br />
ExoPC. It&rsquo;s difficult at this point to give any strong recommendations to any tablet running Windows 7.&nbsp; Windows 8 is on the horizon, and with the amount of development and attention being given to this tablet-centered OS, it seems a sure bet that Windows 7 tablet support will fall to non-existent at record-breaking speed.<br />
<br />
Even forgetting that issue, reviews of the tablet were mixed.&nbsp; One web site gave it high scores, particularly for its sensitive touch screen and intuitive user interface.&nbsp; Others found a number of bugs and performance issues.&nbsp; Its large, high-resolution screen and high sound quality are among its highest points.&nbsp; Its weight and short battery life are among its lowest.&nbsp; Overall it seemed like a decent enough mixed bag, but given the rapid market changes, it&rsquo;s hard to guarantee that this tablet now approaching its first birthday has a much longer shelf life.<br />

These are very quick summaries of some of the well-reviewed tablets out there.&nbsp; These aren&rsquo;t the only tablets, and even for the above there are many fine points that the consumer will want to take a closer look at before purchasing.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in the tablet era now, but these toys are no cheap thrill.&nbsp; With your list of options increasingly rapidly, there is no reason to go haphazardly throwing your money away.
